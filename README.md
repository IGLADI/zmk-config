This my custom ZMK keymap designed for the Sofle Split Keyboard. [It can also be used with smaller boards](#modularity) like the corne. The keymap focuses on daily use, development, and gaming, while ensuring ergonomic and efficiency.

- ðŸŸ¨ Optional (gaming-only) keys
- ðŸŸ¥ Controversial/optional/movable keys
- ðŸŸ¦ Swappable keys

## Idea

The keymap is designed with the following goals in mind:

-   **Compatibility across PCs**: Converts QWERTY and AZERTY layouts to **Colemak-DH**.
-   **Ergonomics and Efficiency**: Reduces (inconfortable) finger movements.
-   **No Homerow Mod**: Prevents accidental shortcut activations.
-   **Common Shortcuts**: Keeps all necessary shortcuts easily accessible and add redundancy for modifiers just in case.
-   **Language-Specific Keys**: Maintains support for keys used in french.
-   **Gaming Layer**: Dedicated gaming layer for keybinding compatibility with games.

## Modularity

This keymap is highly customizable. Here are some suggestions for modifications:

-   **Remove Top Row**: If you're using a smaller keyboard, you can remove the top row, as it is only meant to be used while gaming.
-   **Remove Direct Gaming Layer Access + Right Ctrl**: If you have a smaller thumb cluster, you can moove the gaming layer in the layout rotation.
-   **Homerow Mod**: If you prefer using the homerow mod, you can replace mod taps on the thumb cluster with this method.
-   **Switching Key Positions**: Swap `-` and `+` or `_` and `` ` `` for easier memorization. `-` and `_` are used more frequently, hence there placement.
-   **Using a different layout**: You can switch to a different layout, any alternative layout will be a bing improvement over QWERTY/AZERTY so just pick one and enjoy.
-   **Remove rotary encoders/display**: If you don't have rotary encoders or a display, you can simply remove their configurations.
-   **Swapping Thumb Clusters**: Swap the thumb clusters of hands.

## Improvements

Feel free to make improvements or share any feedback. This keymap is still WIP, and Iâ€™m open to suggestions.
